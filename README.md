# how to run
The code is written in Python3 under the jupyer-notebook. Therefore, you will need to run the code using jupyter-notebook.

I have provide data under the '1m_data' folder. The main training data is inside the '1m_data' folder in csv format. you will need to unzip the file. The file name under the folder is called 'dud_number' which stands for up and down data, data_up_down. You will need to put the 'process.ipynb' file in parllel with the '1m_data' folder under same position. I will also provide the google link all my .pcapng file that generate these csv file. The reason for me to provide only csv file is that even i provide the pcapng file to you. you need to type the filter comment in the wireshark window to get the correct data sequency. The filter command need mac mac address and iphone mac address. However, the iphone mac address change everytime you switch the new hotspot. Therefore, it is really hard for you to just having .pcapng file and generate the csv file since you don't know exactly what will the mac address for the iphone. I will provide the link here for all .pcapng file. Let me know if you want me to clarify anything. (I am really sad the unsw online submission only accept 100MB)
